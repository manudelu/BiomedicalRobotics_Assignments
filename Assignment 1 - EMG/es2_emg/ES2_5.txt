Thinking about different ways to map EMG activity, we came up with different processing that can be applied to the signal after the preprocessing phase.
For example, instead of using the derivative block (as in exercise 2.4) we could use a cumulative or integral block: in this way a positive signal would correspond to an increase in the cumulative amplitude, while a negative signal would correspond to a decrease, and when this signal returnes to the value 0 it indicates that the cursor has returned to the starting position, i.e. the center.
Browsing the internet, we also found several papers that use more complex techniques such as neural network or support vector machine (SVM) to identify complex methods of mapping the EMG signal.
